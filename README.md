*( ) means optional goal, may become mandatory for next meeting*


## Bugs

***A***

- None

***B***

- The timer runs down and can restart you in the Level Complete screen
- The time remaining displayed on the Level Complete screen is not always correct (just saw 7:29)
- Enemies' ground check colliders act erratically unless they're placed directly under platform colliders as in Level 1 (extremely weird)

***C***

- Level complete screen flashes at the end of its entry animation
- Meatloaf's run animation plays when you're running into a wall
- If you collide with a platform (but do not land on top of it) at the peak of your jump, your double jump will be reset

*About bug ranks*
- *A rank: Causes the game to become completely unplayable*
- *B rank: Negatively affects gameplay*
- *C rank: Visual error, doesn't affect gameplay at all*
